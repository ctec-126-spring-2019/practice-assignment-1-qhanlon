    <h1>Practice Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>Brief Description</h2>
    <p>My name is Quinn Hanlon and I'm 24 years old. My latest thing I started doing again is Ocarina of Time Co-op
        Randomizers with friends which is a fun way to make a single player game multiplayer. The quarantine hasn't
        changed my life too much since I normally live mostly inside anyway.</p>
    <h2>Class Goals and Experience</h2>
    <p>I hope to learn how to use JavaScript and figure out whether or not it's something I'll want to broaden my
        understanding of later to further my capabilities if I pursue this as a career.</p>
    <p>My programming skill is at an intermediate beginner level I'd say. I've coded in the following languages but am
        not "fluent" in any of them. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS (tho not really a "language")</li>
    </ul>
